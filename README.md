# web_scraper

Description:
Developed a robust web scraping tool to extract product data from Flipkart's search results using Python and libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and pandas. The tool collected key product attributes, including names, prices, ratings, reviews, and manufacturer details, across multiple pages of search results. The scraped data was processed and deployed on Render to enable dynamic analysis. Users can paste a link and specify the number of pages to analyze for insights on product trends or comparisons. This project showcases expertise in web scraping, data processing, dynamic content handling, and deployment for real-time data visualization.
